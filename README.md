The website starts with an introductory page where the campaign information and outlets, contact number, and a sign-up button is displayed. Once the sign-up button is clicked, the user is redirected to a sign-up form where details such as first name, last name, gender, contact number, etc., is asked of them. In cases where they left a field blank or they put in an invalid input, an alert will show. They can only proceed once they have properly filled in the fields. Once done, they may click the sign-up button and their inputs will be displayed orderly. The data they input has been stored in a localStorage, thus, their input will remain intact even when the site has been refreshed.
